The client-server application for tracking expenses on a website is developed using C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Entity framework, co-created by Aleksandra Modrzejewska and Dominika Nowak.

This application consists of two parts: a client and a server. The client is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs in a web browser. The server, on the other hand, is written in C# and uses the Entity framework technology to access the SQL database.

The main purpose of the application is to allow users to add their expenses and store them in the database. The user can add a new expense by providing its name, category, amount, and date. Each added expense is saved in the database and displayed in a table on the webpage, where the user can view all their expenses. Additionally, the application allows users to view statistics of their expenses.

This application is an ideal tool for people who want to keep track of their expenses and monitor them in real-time. Using C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Entity framework technologies, this application is user-friendly and provides users with all the necessary functionalities for managing their expenses.

The application will be further extended to include login and registration functionality. Additionally, the future development plans of the application include the ability to host the application.
